[![Build](https://github.com/rutanio/Rutanio-Core/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/rutanio/Rutanio-Core/actions/workflows/build.yml)

## 💿 Installation

You'll find the latest releases on the [releases](https://github.com/rutanio/Rutanio-Core/releases) tab. Make sure you pick the latest release.

### Windows

For Windows, we only support 64-bit installations of Windows.

Simply download the latest win-x64.exe file from the [releases](https://github.com/rutanio/Rutanio-Core/releases) page and run
the installer. You might need to approve installation of unsigned installer. This will only
be required until we have a signed release available.

### Linux

For Linux, use the new AppImage installer format. This is included in a lot of
Linux distributions, including Ubuntu.

Download the latest linux-x86_64.AppImage from the [releases](https://github.com/rutanio/Rutanio-Core/releases) page.

Open a terminal, navigate to the download folder and make the .AppImage an executeable with
the following command:

```
$ chmod a+x Rutanio.Core*.AppImage
```

Then you can simply run the installer:

```
$ ./Rutanio.Core*.AppImage
```

### Mac

For OSX, we use .dmg packages.

Download the latest osx-x64.dmg from the [releases](https://github.com/rutanio/Rutanio-Core/releases) page.

### Development environment

Make sure you have Node.JS install, and open a console promt and navigate to the root of the repo.

```sh
# Install the packages if you have not yet.
npm install
```
